# Termos
Termos is a Terminal Os made in x86 assembly and C++.
Termos is a project aimed to improve support of pre existing standards and cross compatibility as well as improving access to a enviroment meant for tinkering. This allows people to create more odball software and hopefully create a community of programming that is inviting to armature programmers and professionals alike!
Main Plan:
> Make Font Support and Boot page.
> Boot in 16bit mode and Display simple page greating user.
> add 16bit setup to allow user to set up pc and then go into 32 bit mode and later 64 bit mode if available.
> Make simple command line that can display results and catch errors and get input commands from user.
Usability:
> Rudimentary G.U.I. Desktop
> File system (Folder system)
> File Editor and Executor
That's all for now, but I will try to update this as thoroughly as possible.
